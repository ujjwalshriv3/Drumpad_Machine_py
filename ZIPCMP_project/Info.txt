Note: This script will only work on windows and linux because it uses the zip command to compress the files/folders and zip command is only available on windows and linux and not on mac.

// Steps:

1. *first download and install latest version of python from python.org check the box to add python to path during installation.
2. then move the files or folder You want to compress in this directory (optional as you can input path of The file in argument).
3. then open the command prompt/terminal.
4. navigate to this folder using cd command and type : python zipfiles.py {your file/folder path here} and press Enter (without the curly braces).
cd command is used to navigate to a directory, for example if you want to navigate to the desktop, type cd Desktop and press enter.

*if you want to compress multiple files/folders at once, type : python zipfiles.py {file1} {file2} {file3} and press Enter (without the curly braces)

5. then you will get a zip file with the same name as your file/folder name.
finally You will see a new file with .zip extension and same name will get created in the same directory.

// Examples:
-for compressing a file named "test.txt" in the same directory, type:

python zipfiles.py test.txt
python zipfiles.py test.txt test2.txt

-for folder named "testfolder" in the same directory, type:

python zipfiles.py testfolder
python zipfiles.py testfolder testfolder2

// features:

1. It will compress the file/folder in the same directory.
2. It will compress the file/folder with same name and .zip extension.
3. You can also use this script to compress multiple files/folders at once.
4. You can also use this script to compress files/folders from different directories.
5. future updates will also add ability to read contents of and decompress files/folders.

// Problems: 
1. I have a folder with 1000s of files and I want to compress them all in one go and I don't want to do it manually.
2. If you are passing a file name then you cant pass a folder name with th same run of the script and vice versa.

// Bug
1. scrtoprgswitcher not working properly or implemented properly which is used to switch between the script and manual program.
