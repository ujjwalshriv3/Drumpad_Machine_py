To create a set in python, you can use the set() function.
  example=[1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5,5,5]
  x= set(example)
  print(x)
    #{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
  x.pop()
    #1
  x.pop()
    #2
  print(x)
    #{3,4,5}
    
>>> example=[1,2,2,3,4,5,5,5,5,5,0]
>>> x=set(example)
>>> print(x)
{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
>>> x.pop()
0
>>> print(x)
{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

>>> x.discard(4)
>>> print(x)
{1, 2, 3, 5}

Inbuilt set methods:
Type help(set()) to see detail

 |  add(...)
 |      Add an element to a set.
 |      
 |      This has no effect if the element is already present.
 |  
 |  clear(...)
 |      Remove all elements from this set.
 |  
 |  copy(...)
 |      Return a shallow copy of a set.
 |  
 |  difference(...)
 |      Return the difference of two or more sets as a new set.
 |      
 |      (i.e. all elements that are in this set but not the others.)
 |  
 |  difference_update(...)
 |      Remove all elements of another set from this set.
 |  
 |  discard(...)
 |      Remove an element from a set if it is a member.
 |      
 |      If the element is not a member, do nothing.
 |  
 |  intersection(...)
 |      Return the intersection of two sets as a new set.
 |      
 |      (i.e. all elements that are in both sets.)
 |  
 |  intersection_update(...)
 |      Update a set with the intersection of itself and another.
 |  
 |  isdisjoint(...)
 |      Return True if two sets have a null intersection.
 |  
 |  issubset(...)
 |      Report whether another set contains this set.
 |  
 |  issuperset(...)
 |      Report whether this set contains another set.
 |  
 |  pop(...)
 |      Remove and return an arbitrary set element.
 |      Raises KeyError if the set is empty.
 |  
 |  remove(...)
 |      Remove an element from a set; it must be a member.
 |      
 |      If the element is not a member, raise a KeyError.
 |  
 |  symmetric_difference(...)
 |      Return the symmetric difference of two sets as a new set.
 |      
 |      (i.e. all elements that are in exactly one of the sets.)
 |  
 |  symmetric_difference_update(...)
 |      Update a set with the symmetric difference of itself and another.
 |  
 |  union(...)
 |      Return the union of sets as a new set.
 |      
 |      (i.e. all elements that are in either set.)
 |  
 |  update(...)
 |      Update a set with the union of itself and others.
