ourNumber will hold the number given by the user.
input() will wait for a user input.
Inside the input () can be left blank but I like to add something to show the user.

print() will display anything held within.
When printing words use "" but for variables just use their name.



ourNumber = input("Enter a number: ")
print(ourNumber + "... I have seen better.")
