# Tkinter Programming

Tkinter is the standard GUI library for Python. Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI applications. Tkinter provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI toolkit.

Creating a GUI application using Tkinter is an easy task. All you need to do is perform the following steps −

* Import the Tkinter module.

## Example

```python
#!/usr/bin/python

import tkinter
top = tkinter.Tk()
# Code to add widgets will go here...
top.mainloop()
```
