The syntax to open a file object in Python is:  

```python
file_object  = open(�filename�, �mode�)  
```

"file_object" is the variable to add the file object.  
"filename" is the... file name! :)  
"mode"  tells the interpreter which way the file will be used.   

The modes are:  

�r� � Read mode which is used when the file is only being read   
�w� � Write mode which is used to edit and write new information to the file (any existing files with the same name will be erased when this mode is activated)  
�a� � Appending mode, which is used to add new data to the end of the file; that is new information is automatically amended to the end  
�r+� � Special read and write mode, which is used to handle both actions when working with a file
