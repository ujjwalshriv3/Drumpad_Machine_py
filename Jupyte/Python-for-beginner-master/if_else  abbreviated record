## Python 3.x
An example of how to write an if/else construct

Next instruction:

```python
if X:
    A = Y
else:
    A = Z
```
This will give the output as follows:
> True

Short, but, nevertheless, occupies the whole 4 lines. 
Especially for such cases, an if / else expression was invented:

```python
A = Y if X else Z
```

In this instruction, the interpreter will execute the expression Y, if X is true, otherwise the expression Z will be executed.
